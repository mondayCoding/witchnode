className=\"cont\">The domestic cat (Felis silvestris catus or Felis catus)[1][5] is a \r\n            small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats[6] when kept as \r\n            indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and \r\n            felines. They are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. \r\n            There are more than seventy cat breeds recognized by various cat registries.\r\n\r\n            Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felids, with a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, \r\n            sharp retractable claws and teeth adapted to killing small prey. Cat senses fit a crepuscular \r\n            and predatory ecological niche. Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for \r\n            human ears, such as those made by mice and other small animals. They can see in near darkness. \r\n            Like most other mammals, cats have poorer color vision and a better sense of smell than humans. \r\n            Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social species, and cat communication includes the use \r\n            of a variety of vocalizations (mewing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting) as well \r\n            as cat pheromones and types of cat-specific body language.[7]\r\n\r\n            Cats have a high breeding rate.[8] Under controlled breeding, they can be bred and shown as \r\n            registered pedigree pets, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the breeding of pet \r\n            cats by neutering, as well as the abandonment of former household pets, has resulted in large \r\n            numbers of feral cats worldwide, requiring population control.[9] In certain areas outside cats' \r\n            native range, this has contributed, along with habitat destruction and other factors, to the \r\n            extinction of many bird species. Cats have been known to extirpate a bird species within specific \r\n            regions and may have contributed to the extinction of isolated island populations.[10] Cats are \r\n            thought to be primarily responsible for the extinction of 33 species of birds,\r\n            [better source needed] and the presence of feral and free-ranging cats makes some otherwise \r\n            suitable locations unsuitable for attempted species reintroduction.[11]\r\n\r\n            Because cats were venerated in ancient Egypt, they were commonly believed to have been \r\n            domesticated there,[12] but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the \r\n            Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7500 BC).[13] A genetic study in 2007[14] concluded that \r\n            all domestic cats are descended from Near Eastern wildcats, having diverged around 8000 BC in \r\n            the Middle East.[12][15] A 2016 study found that leopard cats were undergoing domestication \r\n            independently in China around 5500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves \r\n            no trace in the domesticated populations of today.[16][17] A 2017 study confirmed that domestic \r\n            cats are descendants of those first domesticated by farmers in the Near East around 9,000 years \r\n            ago.[18][19]\r\n\r\n            As of a 2007 study, cats are the second-most popular pet in the U.S. by number of pets owned, \r\n            behind freshwater fish.[20] In a 2010 study, they were ranked the third-most popular pet in the \r\n            UK, after fish and dogs, with around 8 million being owned.[21] </p>\r\n\r\n            <p className=\"cont\">The domestic cat is believed to have evolved from the Near Eastern wildcat,\r\n             whose range covers vast portions of the Middle East westward to the Atlantic coast of Africa.\r\n             [22][23] Between 70,000 and 100,000 years ago the animal gave rise to the genetic lineage that \r\n             eventually produced all domesticated cats,[24] having diverged from the Near Eastern wildcat \r\n             around 8,000 BC in the Middle East.[12][15]\r\n\r\n            The felids are a rapidly evolving family of mammals that share a common ancestor only 10–15 \r\n            million years ago[25] and include lions, tigers, cougars and many others. Within this family, \r\n            domestic cats (Felis catus) are part of the genus Felis, which is a group of small cats \r\n            containing about seven species (depending upon classification scheme).[1][26] Members of \r\n            the genus are found worldwide and include the jungle cat (Felis chaus) of southeast Asia,\r\n            European wildcat (F. silvestris silvestris), African wildcat (F. s. lybica), the Chinese \r\n            mountain cat (F. bieti), and the Arabian sand cat (F. margarita), among others.[27]</p>\r\n\r\n            <h2><a id=\"scrollTwo\" href=\"#\">Taxonomy</a></h2>\r\n            <p className=\"cont\">The domestic cat was first classified as Felis catus by Carl Linnaeus in \r\n            the 10th edition of his Systema Naturae published in 1758.[1][2] Because of modern phylogenetics, \r\n            domestic cats are usually regarded as another subspecies of the wildcat, F. silvestris.[1][28][29] \r\n            This has resulted in mixed usage of the terms, as the domestic cat can be called by its \r\n            subspecies name, Felis silvestris catus.[1][28][29] Wildcats have also been referred to as \r\n            various subspecies of F. catus,[29] but in 2003, the International Commission on Zoological \r\n            Nomenclature fixed the name for wildcats as F. silvestris.[30] The most common name in use for \r\n            the domestic cat remains F. catus. Sometimes, the domestic cat has been called Felis \r\n            domesticus[31] as proposed by German naturalist J.C.P. Erxleben in 1777,[32] but these are not \r\n            valid taxonomic names and have been used only rarely in scientific literature.[33] A \r\n            population of Transcaucasian black feral cats was once classified as Felis daemon (Satunin 1904) \r\n            but now this population is considered to be a part of domestic cat.[34]\r\n\r\n            All the cats in this genus share a common ancestor that is believed to have lived around \r\n            6–7 million years ago in the Near East (the Middle East).[35] The exact relationships within \r\n            the Felidae are close but still uncertain,[36][37] e.g. the Chinese mountain cat is sometimes \r\n            classified (under the name Felis silvestris bieti) as a subspecies of the wildcat, like the \r\n            North African variety F. s. lybica.[28][36]</p>\r\n\r\n            <h2><a id=\"scrollThree\" href=\"#\">otsikko</a></h2>\r\n            <p className=\"cont\">Domestic cats are similar in size to the other members of the genus Felis, \r\n            typically weighing between 4 and 5 kg (9 and 10 lb).[36] Some breeds, such as the Maine Coon,\r\n            can occasionally exceed 11 kg (24 lb). Conversely, very small cats, less than 2 kg (4 lb), have \r\n            been reported.[59] The world record for the largest cat is 21 kg (50 lb).[60] The smallest \r\n            adult cat ever officially recorded weighed around 1 kg (2 lb).[60] Feral cats tend to be \r\n            lighter as they have more limited access to food than house cats. In the Boston area, the \r\n            average feral adult male will weigh 4 kg (9 lb) and average feral female 3 kg (7 lb).[61] \r\n            Cats average about 23–25 cm (9–10 in) in height and 46 cm (18 in) in head/body length \r\n            (males being larger than females), with tails averaging 30 cm (12 in) in length.[62] </p>\r\n\r\n            <h2><a id=\"scrollFour\" href=\"#\">otsikko</a></h2>\r\n            <p className=\"cont\">Curabitur aliquet semper molestie.

For example, even if other promises given to the\n  `promises` array argument are resolved, but the first settled promise has\n  become rejected before the other promises became fulfilled, the returned\n  promise will become rejected:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      resolve('promise 1');\n    }, 200);\n  });\n\n  let promise2 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    setTimeout(function(){\n      reject(new Error('promise 2'));\n    }, 100);\n  });\n\n  Promise.race([promise1, promise2]).then(function(result){\n    // Code here never runs\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'promise 2' because promise 2 became rejected before\n    // promise 1 became fulfilled\n  });\n  ```\n\n  An example real-world use case is implementing timeouts:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Promise.race([ajax('foo.json'), timeout(5000)])\n  ```\n\n  @method race\n  @static\n  @param {Array} promises array of promises to observe\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise which settles in the same way as the first passed\n  promise to settle.\n*/\nexport default function race(entries) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n\n  if (!isArray(entries)) {\n    return new Constructor(function (_, reject) {\n      return reject(new TypeError('You must pass an array to race.'));\n    });\n  } else {\n    return new Constructor(function (resolve, reject) {\n      var length = entries.length;\n      for (var i = 0; i < length; i++) {\n        Constructor.resolve(entries[i]).then(resolve, reject);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// lib/es6-promise/promise/race.js","import { noop, reject as _reject } from '../-internal';\n\n/**\n  `Promise.reject` returns a promise rejected with the passed `reason`.\n  It is shorthand for the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n    reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Instead of writing the above, your code now simply becomes the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let promise = Promise.reject(new Error('WHOOPS'));\n\n  promise.then(function(value){\n    // Code here doesn't run because the promise is rejected!\n  }, function(reason){\n    // reason.message === 'WHOOPS'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method reject\n  @static\n  @param {Any} reason value that the returned promise will be rejected with.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise} a promise rejected with the given `reason`.\n*/\nexport default function reject(reason) {\n  /*jshint validthis:true */\n  var Constructor = this;\n  var promise = new Constructor(noop);\n  _reject(promise, reason);\n  return promise;\n}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// lib/es6-promise/promise/reject.js","function _classCallCheck(instance, Constructor) { if (!(instance instanceof Constructor)) { throw new TypeError(\"Cannot call a class as a function\"); } }\n\nimport { isFunction } from './utils';\nimport { noop, nextId, PROMISE_ID, initializePromise } from './-internal';\nimport { asap, setAsap, setScheduler } from './asap';\n\nimport all from './promise/all';\nimport race from './promise/race';\nimport Resolve from './promise/resolve';\nimport Reject from './promise/reject';\nimport then from './then';\n\nfunction needsResolver() {\n  throw new TypeError('You must pass a resolver function as the first argument to the promise constructor');\n}\n\nfunction needsNew() {\n  throw new TypeError(\"Failed to construct 'Promise': Please use the 'new' operator, this object constructor cannot be called as a function.\");\n}\n\n/**\n  Promise objects represent the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @param {Function} resolver\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\n\nvar Promise = function () {\n  function Promise(resolver) {\n    this[PROMISE_ID] = nextId();\n    this._result = this._state = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n   Chaining\n  --------\n   The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n   findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we're unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n   Assimilation\n  ------------\n   Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n   If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n   ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n   Simple Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let result;\n   try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n   Promise Example;\n   ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n   Advanced Example\n  --------------\n   Synchronous Example\n   ```javascript\n  let author, books;\n   try {\n    author = findAuthor();\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n   Errback Example\n   ```js\n   function foundBooks(books) {\n   }\n   function failure(reason) {\n   }\n   findAuthor(function(author, err){\n    if (err) {\n      failure(err);\n      // failure\n    } else
